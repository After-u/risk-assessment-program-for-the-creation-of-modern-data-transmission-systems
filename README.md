a web application that will allow for the assessment of risk indicators and ensure the security and reliability of data transmission when creating data networks.
The statistical method of kernel estimation of the probability density (PRD) was taken as the basis for the methodology for estimating risk indicators.
ROPV is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability density of a random variable based on a set of its values. In the context of data transfer,
this method can be used to estimate the probability of packet loss during data transmission based on the observed values ​​of this indicator.
This method is based on the use of a kernel function that is applied to each sample point to create a smooth approximation of the probability density.
A kernel function is a smooth function
which is multiplied by each point in the sample and added together to create a probability density estimate. The smoother the kernel function, the smoother the resulting estimate of the probability density will be.
